### The Problem

As a developer, I found frameworks such as Bootstrap and Zurb Foundation to be too heavy handed for many of my own projects. Often to offset this weight I would employ a CSS reset stylesheet and continue to only create the CSS styles I needed at the time. While this approach worked, it was ineffective to scale and often had many repeat commonalities from project to project. You can only create `.button` so many times to were the properities are only subtly different.

Additonally I could not find many frameworks that adhered to the BEM methodology (Block, Element Modifier). Bootstrap also did not have a way to easily modify class names to fit any sort of methodology.
